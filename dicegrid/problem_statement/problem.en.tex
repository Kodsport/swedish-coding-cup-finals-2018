\problemname{Dice Grid}
Simon has an unusually large amount of dice, owing to his love for the game \emph{Liar's dice} which requires just that.
This has resulted in Simon inventing a large number of new games concering dice.
His newest one is called \emph{Dice Grid}.

Dice Grid is a single-player game, where the goal is to maximize one's score.
It is played on a $N \times M$ grid of squares.
At the start of the game, the player places a regular 6-sided die on the top left square.
The goal is to move it to the bottom right square, by rolling it down $N-1$ times and to the right $M-1$ times.
% TODO: figure of this
For every of the $N + M - 1$ squares that the dice is placed on, the score of that square is the number that shows on top of the die when it was placed on that square.
The score of the game is the sum of the scores of all those squares.

What is the maximum score Simon can achieve, assuming he plays optimally?

When the die is placed on the starting square, the number $1$ is at the bottom, $6$ is at the top, $2$ is at the front of the die (meaning it would be at the bottom if the die was rolled to the next row), $4$ is on the right side of the die (meaning it would be at the bottom if the die was rolled to the next column), $3$ is to the left of the die, and $5$ is at the back of the die.

\section*{Input}
The first and only line of input contains the two integers $1 \le N, M \le 10^9$ -- the number of rows and columns of the grid.

\section*{Output}
Output a single line -- the maximum score Simon can obtain.
