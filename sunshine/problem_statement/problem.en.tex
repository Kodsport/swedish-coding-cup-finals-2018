\problemname{Sunshine}
% Unusually hot in Stockholm, constant sunshine for 20 days in a row, etc.

We have weather prognosis data for the next $N$ days, that
tell us how likely it is that each day will be sunny.
We assume that these events are independent of each other.

What is the probability of having a streak of $K$ days in a row
of sun during these $N$ days?

\section*{Input}
The first line of input contains the two integers $N, K$ ($1 \le K \le N$).
The second line of input contains $N$ floating-point numbers $p_i$ ($0 \le p_i \le 1$) --
the probability of each day being sunny.

\section*{Output}
Output a single number -- the probability of having a streak of $K$ days in a row
of sun during the $N$ days.
The answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$.

\section*{Scoring}
Your solution will be tested on a set of test groups, each worth a number of points.
To get the points for a test group you need to solve all test cases in the test group.
Your final score will be the maximum score of a single submission.
